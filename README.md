# 31761 - Renewables in Electricity Markets
This repository is intended for the individual projects of the course '31761 - Renewables in Electricity' from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and teached by [Pierre Pinson](http://pierrepinson.com/). It contains all the data, scripts, literature, and reports for each assignment.

# Program
All assignments are coded in either [Julia](https://www.julialang.org/) or [Python](https://www.python.org/). For the Julia code, I tried to follow Invenia's [Blue](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle) guidelines for code styling.

# Assignment 1
The first assignment aimed to evaluate day-ahead electricity markets knowledge, the day-ahead market mechanism modelling, our ability to use real-world data as input, and our critical analysis of the results generated.

The set-up of the assignment was a real-world approach to clearing the day-ahead market with certain number of suppliers (two wind supplier in each region).
